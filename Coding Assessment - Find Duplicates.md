# Coding Assessment - Find Duplicates

**Time allocation:** 4 hours

## Instructions

You have been asked to take a list of contact information and identify which contacts are potentially duplicates. You need to write a function that will do the following:

1. Identify which contacts are possible matches.
2. A score for each match that represents how accurate you believe the match is. This scoring is defined by you.
3. A contact might have multiple or no matches
4. All processing should be done in working memory (no database).

### Example

**Input**

| Contact ID | First Name | Last Name | Email Address | Zip Code | Address |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------|--------|
| 1001 | C | F | mollis.lectus.pede@outlook.net | | 449-6990 Tellus. Rd. |
| 1002 | C | French | mollis.lectus.pede@outlook.net | 39746 | 449-6990 Tellus. Rd. |
| 1003 | Ciara | F | non.lacinia.at@zoho.ca | 39746 | |

**Output**

| ContactID Source | ContactID Match | Accuracy |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| 1001 | 1002 | High |
| 1001 | 1003 | Low |

The input file is included in the assessment packet.

## Deliverables

As part of your solution you will need to produce:

1. The code used to identify the potential duplicates
2. A set of tests that you use to verify the functions
3. Comments in the code are welcome
